# NeuroMesh SDK (Python)

**NeuroMesh SDK** defines the *humanoid-first intelligence layer* that any robot or agent can install to become **software-defined**, **safety-bounded**, and **market-connected** within the Solana-based NeuroMesh Superbrain.

The SDK provides a local runtime and APIs for on-robot cognition, proof generation, and attested data ownership.  
Each agent runs autonomous reasoning loops (`sense → think → act → learn`), producing verifiable *Composite Thought/Action Vectors (CTV/A)* that encode perception, action, safety verification, evaluator scores, and royalty metadata.

## ✳️ Architecture Overview

At its core, the SDK emulates the **NeuroOS-H** stack:

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent Runtime (NeuroAgent)  │
│  ├─ Perception (sense)      │
│  ├─ Planning (think)        │
│  ├─ Actuation (act)         │
│  └─ Adaptation (learn)      │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Proof System (PoI / PoA)    │
│  └─ Hash + Signature Chains │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Safety Envelope (CBC)       │
│  └─ Runtime invariant check │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Data Rights (DOC / PLID)    │
│  └─ Tokenised Data Assets   │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Each cognitive cycle emits a **CTV/A**, the atomic unit of verifiable intelligence in NeuroMesh.

## ⚙️ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `NeuroAgent` | Base class implementing the full agent lifecycle with embedded Proof-of-Inference (PoI) and Proof-of-Action (PoA) generation. |
| **CTV/A Generator** | Bundles sensory inputs, planned actions, verification receipts, and evaluator results into an immutable object. |
| **CBC Safety Envelope** | Ensures motion/interaction constraints remain within certifiable bounds. |
| **Data Rights Minting** | Produces cryptographically verifiable Data Ownership Certificates (DOC) and Perception Lineage IDs (PLID). |
| **Network Hooks** | Simulated endpoints for mesh discovery and receipt publication. |

## 🔬 Mathematical Background

The SDK models agentic intelligence density as

\[
I = \log N \times \bar{\beta} \times CI
\]

where \( N \) is the number of active robots, \( \bar{\beta} \) is the useful message rate, and \( CI \) the coherence index derived from evaluator consensus.

Safety invariants follow a simplified Control-Barrier-Certificate:

\[
P_{\text{unsafe}} \le \varepsilon_s
\]

such that the agent’s actuation remains within its local safety manifold.

## 🧩 Example Usage

```bash
pip install -e .
python examples/run_agent_demo.py
```

This spins up a simulated robot node, runs a full cognitive loop, and publishes a mock CTV/A to the mesh.

Development Notes
	•	Written in Python 3.12 with Pydantic, Cryptography, and FastAPI dependencies.
	•	Fully type-hinted for static analysis.
	•	GitHub Actions CI included (commented out for manual enablement).
	•	Dockerfile: python:3.12-slim, exposing port 8787.

# NeuroMesh Receipts Explorer

The **NeuroMesh Receipts Explorer** provides a visual interface for the **Decentralised Superbrain**—a mesh of humanoid agents, each producing cryptographically attested cognitive artefacts (CTV/A).

It integrates a lightweight **FastAPI backend** (mock data service) with a **React/Vite frontend**, allowing researchers, developers, and institutional partners to visualise live metrics of the network’s agentic intelligence density, data rights flow, and robot participation.

## 🧠 Conceptual Overview

Humanoid Robots ─► CTV/A Receipts ─► Mesh Nodes ─► Explorer Dashboard
↑                                    │
└──── Proof-of-Inference / Proof-of-Action (PoI/PoA) ─────┘

Each entry in the dashboard corresponds to a verified *Composite Thought/Action Vector*, the fundamental RWA unit of NeuroMesh intelligence.

## 🧩 System Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Function |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Frontend | React + Vite + TypeScript | UI rendering, live receipt polling, network visualisation |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) | Serves mock receipts, agents, and health metrics |
| Data | Static JSON | Placeholder for on-chain or SDK-provided receipts |
| Deployment | Docker (Node 20-Alpine) | Compact build and runtime |

The backend and frontend communicate over simple REST endpoints (`/health`, `/receipts`), forming the public observation layer of the NeuroMesh network.
